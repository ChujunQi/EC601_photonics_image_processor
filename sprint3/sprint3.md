# Sprint 3

### FFT
In sprint 3, we built FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) layers for our CNN. If we only use filters and kernels, the speed of our system would be slow when we try to train a large number of data, which is O(n^2). In the real time analysis, it might take even a few hours. However, after using computing FFT for kernels of CNN, the speed will be increased to O(nlogn).
