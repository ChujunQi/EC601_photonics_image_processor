2.Technology Selection and justification
==

- Image Processing: CNN (CNN is mainly used in image recognition and object detection)  
  1) It automatically detects the important features without any human supervision.
- Language: Python
  1) Compared to other languages, Python is easy to read, learn and write.
- Environment: Keras
  1) Keras has a wide range of predefined layers and we can also define our own custom layers.
  2) Keras has one of the best documentation among all the other frameworks.
  3) Compared to other environment, Keras has the ability of easy to code, easy to debug, and being modular 
- Simulation: FPGA
  1) Could get the feedback directly.
 
3.Functional demonstration of major user story
==
### We are still in the start of our project but here is the expected result.
- User story: The user wants to detect wether there is a person in the image or not  
![image](https://github.com/ChujunQi/EC601_photonics_image_processor/blob/main/Sprint2/pics/example.png)  
- Expexted result: The result shows that there is a person in the image and the analysis time is short.
