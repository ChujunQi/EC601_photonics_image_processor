# EC601_photonics_image_processing
## Introduction
1. We will use CNN for image processing, the type of CNN could be AlexNet, VGG 16, or ResNet. They have different functionalities, but all of them are suitable for image processing.
2. Try to replace the first group of convolutional layers to optical layers in order to speed up the system.

## Product Mission
We aims to let our product detect or recognize things in images or videos automatically, having faster speed on image processing than the usual image processor, and Having high accuracy on recognizing important features in images.

## MVPs
1. Can detect the main feature of images or videos
2. Dealing with multiple things 
3. Using optical functionalities to speed our image processing system

## User Stories
1. Government: use face recognition to find criminals.
2. Smartphone users: unlock phone with face recognition and find things online by taking a photo

## Development Environment
1. Language: Python
2. Environment: Tensorflow, Keras
